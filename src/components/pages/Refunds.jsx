    <p><strong>Guest Cancellations:</strong></p>
    <p>
      If you cancel your confirmed booking at least 48 hours before the event start time, you’ll receive a full refund of the payment you made, minus the service fees and any applicable taxes (including any partner guest shares). Refunds will be processed within 5-7 working days.
    </p>
    <p>If you cancel less than 48 hours before the event, no refund will be issued.</p>
    <p>
      If your cancellation (made 48+ hours before the event) causes the event to fall below the minimum guest count set by the Host, the Host may choose to either proceed with or cancel the event—provided they notify us at least 24 hours before the event starts. Hosts can only exercise this cancellation option twice per month.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you cancel less than 48 hours before the event and it drops below the minimum guests, the Host must proceed if other guests are still attending. In this case, the Host will receive 100% of the penalty fees charged to the guest (excluding service fees and taxes).
    </p>
    <p>
      Guests who cancel 5 or more events in a 12-month period will be temporarily barred from booking on BylzParty. They can lift this ban by paying a Rs. 500 reactivation fee.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Host Cancellations:</strong></p>
    <p>If a Host cancels more than 7 days before the event, no penalty or cancellation fee applies.</p>
    <p>
      If a Host cancels within 7 days of the event, they can cancel up to twice a month or have three consecutive cancellations without penalty. Beyond this, the Host will be barred from hosting on BylzParty.
    </p>
    <p>When a Host cancels, guests will receive a refund within a commercially reasonable time.</p>
    <p>Hosts barred for excessive cancellations can reinstate their hosting privileges by paying a Rs. 500 reactivation fee.</p>
    <p>Additional penalties may apply to Hosts who cancel, such as:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>Automated negative reviews posted on their listing,</li>
      <li>Blocking of their calendar for affected dates,</li>
      <li>Cancellation fees deducted from future payouts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In some cases, BylzParty may require Hosts who have canceled events to pay a security deposit of Rs. 5,000 before hosting future events.
    </p>

    <p><strong>BylzParty’s Right to Cancel:</strong></p>
    <p>
      BylzParty reserves the right to cancel any booking for extenuating or unavoidable circumstances at its sole discretion.
